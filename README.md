# Technical test | Front-end intern

This technical test is meant for "Front-end intern" candidates.

All of the tasks are described below. This already gives you an idea about the way we like to work. This is build to test your basic technical capabilities.

## Objectives

-  Build this application by using this stack:
   - React.js
   - TailwindCSS
-  Your app should contains, at least, 2 components (One is already define)
-  You must achieve it in less than 2 hours
-  We will be evaluating what you are able to do based on this. So show us what you're capable of ðŸš€
-  We also expect you to make the right decisions and to be able to explain why you make that decision

## Delivery
We'd like to ask you to create a git repo and manage this test in the same way you would for any other project.

Once you're done with this test we'd please ask you to push this on a private GitHub repo and share it with [axel.avaux@weinvest.be](mailto:axel.avaux@weinvest.be).

## Tasks
- [ ] Create a git repo 
- [ ] Show a counter in the middle of the page, with 0 as default value
- [ ] Increment the counter by 10 when the component is mount
- [ ] Make a button that increments the counter by 1
- [ ] Make a button that decrements the counter by 1
- [ ] Make a button that multiply the counter by 2
- [ ] Make a button that reset the counter to 0
- [ ] Let your imagination run wild and make a nice design with TailwindCSS
- [ ] EXTRA: Convert the app in TypeScript
